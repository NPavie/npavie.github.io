title: About me
---

My name is Nicolas Pavie, and i'm currently working for the [BrailleNet.org](https://www.braillenet.org) association and the [DAISY Consortium](https://www.daisy.org) as a software engineer. 

Please go check their websites and see what we do :)

I'm a passionate about IT in general, from low-level processors' architectures to high-level frameworks and APIs.
I had a crush in my youth for Computer Graphics and decided to further explore this domain in my studies, up to a Ph. D. thesis on real-time rendering of surfacic details.

Among my hobbies, i build PCs (when i can, it's a rather expensive hobby).
I also do some system administration and maintenance for friends and relative, and i'm hosting a home server for inhouse streaming and personnal file backup.

### Academic experience

#### Ph. D. In Computer Graphics @ [Unilim](https://www.unilim.fr)

Thesis on Procedural generation of natural details in realistic image synthesis

> The increase of demanding quality and complexity of computer-generated natural sceneries raises several needs : 
> 
> More appropriate content authoring methods, more efficient storage and interactive display techniques. 
> 
> This thesis focus on answering to those needs, using procedural approaches to produce natural stochastic phenomenon (clouds, complex vegetation ..) with a low memory requirement while keeping efficient rendering of very detailed natural sceneries.

#### Research assitant @ [XLim](https://www.xlim.fr)

Research fields : procedural noises for texture synthesis, real-time rendering, pointbased volume rendering on GPU.

Research missions :
- Assisting in the development, maintenance and optimisation of GobLim, the realtime rendering engine of the Realistic Image synthesis team based on OpenGL 4.3.
- Exploring deployment techniques of the engine for Windows and Linux systems.
- Backporting the rendering engine on Mac OSX systems (openGL 4.1 version).
